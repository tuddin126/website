    Week 8
  </h2>
  <p>
    I learn to change the font and and colour of the text of my webpage.
    I created two different files which is the link to the website and the other was a css file. This way i was able to link them. Under < title> i added <link rel="stylesheet" title="My Style" href="mystyle.css">
    I was able to make the colour of the text and the background of the text the colour i want by adding:
    .discounted_bargain {
    	color: red;
    }

    .damaged_stock {
    	background: yellow;
    }
    I added another paragraph to my link by adding:
    < p class="damaged_stock discounted_bargain">
    Child's Tricycle
    < /p>
    I learnt that apparently notepad ++ is better as it will show you what is a tag.

  <h2>
    Week 9
  </h2>
  <p>
    On the atom app I have learnt to be able to type on more than one line the same thing. This is done by holding ctrl and alt at the same time and then using the arrow keys going up or down.
    I have learnt to change how big the gap between each line can. I have also learnt to change the font to whatever i want.
    I learnt to be able to get the layout of how the web page is created. I have done this by going to the bottom right and changing ‘plain text’ to ‘HTML’ then typed in html and pressed tab which gave me the layout.
    I have installed atom-html-preview, however it does not seem to be working as i had expected as it doesn’t show me the preview of my web page.
