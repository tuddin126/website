  Mitigating corporate information
exposure on the web
Abstract
This literature review will be about the foundations and characteristics needed to manage security
and why it is needed. What can happen if password is reused and how passwords can be figured out.
we will talk about the confidentiality, integrity and availability triad and what they mean. We will
talk about security analysts and what they do, and we will talk about risk assessments.
Businesses and the government collect tons of data and are not able to keep them secure. One
journal (Management's Role in Information Security in a Cyber Economy. Date: September 1, 2002)
stated that security is not a technical issue, but a management issue and has three foundations
which are critical infrastructure, organisation, and technology. These foundations can allow for a
more realistic and effective security than “technology-dominated view” (Amitava Dutta, Kevin
McCrohan; Fall2002, Vol. 45 Issue 1, p67-87, 21p, 2 Diagrams).
</p>
<p>

The first foundation, critical infrastructure, is explained as data “that are so vital that their damage
or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the physical or economic security of the country.”
The second foundation, technology, states businesses must follow certain characteristics to
appropriately manage security. These characteristics are structure, business environment, culture,
politics and standard operating procedures. In businesses the structure refers to how much
authorization is given to people of a certain field. The more important data will be handled by
someone who is of a higher rank to secure the data. Business environment has four factors which
could cause cyberattack. These are Value of the property, changes happening to the business,
accessibility and property. Companies that are big and have many consumers and suppliers and may
have released new products or been in news are more likely to be targeted by hackers. Standard
operation procedure indicates that businesses have procedures for doing things and therefore
should implement this to security as it is important and this can enhance security.
</p>
<p>
The final foundation, technology, suggests that IT staffs are responsible for technological solutions,
however senior managers should also be familiar with the most important components of security.
They must also understand where the security controls are placed, firewalls, intrusion detection
software, password protection, private networks, authentication and key encryption.
One article by Jenkins, Jeffrey L., Grimes, Mark, Proudfoot, Jeffrey Gainer, Lowry, Paul Benjamin
(2014 Vol. 20 Issue 2, p196-213. 18p. 1 Diagram, 7 Charts) states that accounts can be hacked due to
password reuse. An experiment was tested, and results show that passwords can be figured out
based on the users typing behavior as most people reuse their password. It was stated that by
scaring people will they change and use unique passwords.
</p>
<p>
Security professionals use three concepts which can be used as a foundation. This will give a set of
terminology that they can use when there is a security issue. These three concepts are
confidentiality, integrity and availability. Confidentiality is the ability to protect data from those who
are not authorized to have access to the data. confidentiality can be compromised by losing a laptop
or having someone look over people’s shoulder when typing in password or sending an email
containing valuable information to the wrong person. If confidentiality is compromised, it will have a
negative impact on users and companies.
</p>
<p>
Integrity is the ability to prevent unauthorized personal changing or deleting data, however there
can be someone with authorization to change or delete data, but it might not be something the
company wants therefore they must be able to also reverse authorized changes or deletion.
Availability is the ability to access our data whenever it is needed. Users can lose access to their data
if there is “breaks anywhere in the chain that allows us access to our data”. These issues can be
caused from “power loss, operating system or application problems, network attacks, compromise
of a system, or other problems”. If the attack is from an external party, then it is referred to as denial
of service attack (Andress, Jason; 2014).
</p>
<p>
With industries collecting lots of data and storing them, they require places to keep them. Data
centres are where industries store all their data and as there are many information being stored,
companies will have multiple large data centres which have many servers that are connected to
networks. Having lots of servers and networks require security and therefore companies have
security analysts. Analysts must deal with irregular data as data is not stored as one format but
different formats. This can be caused by saving files from different software’s (Talabis, Mark, Martin,
Jason L., Miyamoto, I, McPherson, Robert; 2015).
</p>
<p>
Organisations need to take risk assessments to understand whether the company security has been
compromised or not and the risk assessments must be dealt by a senior leader level and everyone
must assess it, not just the technical staff (Andress, Jason; 2014; Wilschsen Gregory C; 2005; Amitava
Dutta, Kevin McCrohan; 2002; Ahmed Atif, Maynard Sean, Park Sangseo, pg 42; 2014). This is there
to identify if there is any vulnerability in their security and what threats there could potentially be
(Amitava Dutta, Kevin McCrohan; 2002; Andress Jason 2014). Industries advertise their company and
products on the internet where they can get more opportunities however this makes them more
vulnerable as many people have access to their websites.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion businesses and industries must have management deal with their security and follow
the foundations which are critical infrastructure, organisation, and technology. They must also
follow the characteristics structure, business environment, culture, politics and standard operating
procedures to allow for a more realistic and effective security. Companies and users should not
reuse passwords as typing behaviour can help others to figure out their password. Security
professionals use three concepts when there is an issue, these are confidentiality, integrity and
availability. Risk assessments should also happen periodically to make sure that there are no
vulnerability and threats in their security.
